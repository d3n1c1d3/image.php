I love to hear when my work is being used, so if you decide to use this, feel encouraged

back to Shifting Pixel (either this page or shiftingpixel.com), but don't worry about
including a big link on each page if you don't want to; one will do just nicely. Feel
free to contact me to discuss any specifics (joe@shiftingpixel.com).
